# top_size_breakdown_check_and_balance

As part of the downstream processs of Assortment Planning, Inventory Planning & Management, and Product Operations.
After getting approval for high-level purchases, we break down the quantity into product-level, size-level and top-bottom-level.
This script is to :
- visualize the sales ratio, system-suggested ratio and recommended-buy ratio
- the goal is to align these three ratios with some variance-threshold allowed

Improvement :
- the work was done manually before for each individual product and now is displayed mass to help saving time to spot the anomality faster
